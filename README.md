A sketch for scrolling text on the Adafruit 16x8 matrix Featherwings.

Current state: Mostly functional.  Tested with an Adafruit Feamther M0 Express.

**To do**

- Currently works on an Adafruit Feather M0 Express but not a Feather 328p.  Unsure why.
- Needs to robustly detect the number of chars entered and whether or not this overflows the array.
- Write a proper tutorial for using it.
